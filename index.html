          <h2 class="text-center">Biography</h2>
          <p class="text-center">I was born in Leeds in 1946 and I had my first exhibition of large white reliefs in York in 1970. I then began work as a fine art printmaker in London at the ground breaking Kelpra Studio. I worked there from early 1970 until the mid 80s.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Returning north, I continued to make and exhibit prints; followed by a continuous process of re-training. This culminated in a 25 year career as a psychotherapist, spending the last 20 years in an NHS Psychology Department.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center">Words</h3>
          <p class="text-center">The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein believed that "all art is reparation for the hateful feelings we have for our parents"; I began to use the word Reparation as a vehicle, a basis for a particular direction for my work. Some of the Words pieces are of a polemical nature however made of a range of benign materials such as tea, coffee, bird food. The work leads the viewer to notice, to read and absorb questions that are often avoided. It ensures that, like the work of a psychotherapist, some things cannot be ignored.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center">Vessels</h3>
          <p class="text-center">In the early 21st century my work took a new direction leading to an exhibition in Edinburgh in 2004 of reliefs based on an attempt to portray good internal objects. As a result, there was a shift to creating wall hung vessel-like pieces The next step was a growing urge to experience and learn about ceramics. I enrolled in classes at the studio of ceramic artist James Oughtibridge in Holmfirth. Over the years I have developed a way of working that has been a springboard for my current ceramic work.</p>
          <p class="text-center">Unglazed, emphasising the nature of the clay, the work is wholly aesthetic; it is not possible to utilise it for practical purposes. It is, as if, a series of containers; to hold differing parts of ourselves.</p>
